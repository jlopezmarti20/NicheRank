## Dataset Extraction

If you would like to extract a dataset yourself, use the playlist_parse.py script to do this. 
1. Download zip from https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge#dataset 
2. Unzip file into the playlist_database folder.
3. Run the sctip playlist_parse.py with the % of playlists you want to be parsed as a float. The entire database is 1 Million playlists, which takes around 30 minutes. By default, the playlist is 0.1% parsed.
